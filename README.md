# Biomatter Machine Learning enzyme design assignment

I. The task, given data and files (all but amino acid encodings can be find in this repository):



II. The solution, guide to navigating files:

1) The solution is provided in 4 Jupyter notebooks in Python. The first 3 look individually into the three data sources I used: biophysical features, MSA and amino acid representations. The last notebook integrates the three data sources into a final model. The work progresses from first to fourth notebooks.
2) Notebooks 2 and 3 generate files which are used in the notebooks that follow. Those generated files are added to this repository also (Notebook 2: ube2i_msa.fasta, mean_pssm_fitness.csv; Notebook 3: reduced_repr32_flat_df.csv).
3) .pkl file of the final model
